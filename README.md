# YTSEARCHPY

YTSEARCHPY is a python passin project made by the bootleg fish. YTSEARCHPY is a simple to search for things on youtube, lightweight inside your terminal. While it maybe based on a lot of spaghetti code, it still works somehow and i am not to complain.

After Installing The Program And Running Here Is What You Do:

You Enter In What You Want To Search (ex: funny dog clips)
You Enter In What Type Of Content You Want To See (ex: video, channel, playlist)
And Pick The Maximum Amount Of Results You Want To See (ex: 20)

The Results Are Also Archived In A "ytsearchpy_results.txt" File, If You Want To Look At Them From There :D
